                        <h3>Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
                        <p>The first project I did was a personal portfolio web site to demonstrate my skills, academic background, and professional interests. It has provided me with an opportunity to use my knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and to concentrate on design, user experience and content strategy. I got into the project with business perspective of IT so that the site could render my professional worth and future development.</p>
                        <p>This project helped me acquire a hands-on practice in launching a web site with the help of GitHub Pages, creating a clean and responsive design, and laying out information well. This portfolio is a demonstration of my present abilities and a framework that will expand as I do, which will accommodate future academic projects, personal educational experiences, and professional successes.</p>
                        <p>It also gives me a platform to assist in my future growth, where I would improve my studies, improve application skills in internships, and demonstrate my skills to the prospective career in the field of IT.</p>
